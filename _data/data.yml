    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am a PhD candidate in Dr. <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~seth/"  style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Seth Hutchinson</u></a>'s lab.
      My research is focused on developing cooperative manipulation strategies for multi-robot and human-robot cooperative manipulation. 
      I am currently investigating deep reinforcement learning techniques as a novel approach to developing cooperative manipulation
      strategies.

experiences:
    - role: Research Intern
      time: May 2021 - August 2021
      company: Google, Mountain View, California
      details: |
        At Google, I worked on developing reinforcement learning training schemes
        for high-speed robotics. Some of the tools I used during my internship include:
          - Python, Pybullet, TFAgents

    - role: Software Engineering Intern
      time: May 2020 - August 2020
      company: Blue River Technology, Sunnyvale California
      details: |
        At Blue River, I worked with a team of software engineers to develop
        software that was deployed on John Deere Machinery. I worked on adding
        new features to the "see-and-spray" pipeline for sprayer machines. Some of
        the tools I used during my internship include:
          - C++, Version Control (Git), Unittesting with Google test framework
          - Agile-based development (Jira), Flatbuffer, Protocol Buffers

    - role: Robotics Software Intern
      time: May 2019 - August 2019
      company: Bosch (Advanced Corporate Research), Sunnyvale California
      details: |
        At Bosch, I worked on a research team to develop control strategies for manipulator insertion tasks.
        I worked on impedance control schemes to enable a 6 degree-of-freedom manipulator perform peg-in-hole insertion.
          - C++, Python, Rigid Body Dynmaics Library (RBDL)
          - Gazebo, Kinova arm
