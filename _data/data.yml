    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="https://foxrobotics.com/"  style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Fox Robotics</u></a>. 
      Prior to joining Fox Robotics, I got my PhD in Electrical Engineering from The Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). 
      While at Georgia Tech, I was supervised by Dr. <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~seth/"  style="color: blue" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Seth Hutchinson</u></a>.
      My research was focused on developing cooperative manipulation strategies for multi-robot and human-robot cooperative manipulation.
